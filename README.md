This is just quick and dirty made.
Simply select your communityfolder and hit "run".... currently no indicator when it's done ... it runs quite fast, no worries.
It checks each manifest.json file if there is the property "builder" included.

No further development is to be expected as its just needed to run once ...maybe asobo will fix the issue with the content.xml in a couple of years when MSFS2024 leaves public alpha status.


I removed 2233 duplicates.... so if i wouldnt fix the manifest.json files the content.xml grows and grows on each start of msfs2024  

Example how it looks like after msfs2024 has been started 6 times
