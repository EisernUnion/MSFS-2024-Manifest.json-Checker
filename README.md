This is just quick and dirty made.
Simply select your communityfolder and hit "run".... currently no indicator when it's done ... it runs quite fast, no worries.
It checks each manifest.json file if there is the property "builder" included.

No further development is to be expected as its just needed to run once ...maybe asobo will fix the issue with the content.xml in a couple of years.
